#Vue 3 tutorial
This work was drawn from 
https://learnvue.co/2020/12/setting-up-your-first-vue3-project-vue-3-0-release and 
https://auth0.com/blog/getting-started-with-vue-3-composition-api/#Options-API-vs--Composition-API .

What I wanted to learn from this excercise is what makes Vue 3 different and better. I gained an appreciation for Vite and the set up function. I also learned that the CSS framework support for Vue 3 is not great as of July 2021. I will be watching Bootstrap-Vue and Vuetify to see when they fully support Vue 3. At that point I will probably switch over to Vue 3 for personal projects.
